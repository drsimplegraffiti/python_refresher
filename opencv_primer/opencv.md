Images are pixels, black and white for example called binary image

Fixed numbers of pixels
VGA = 640 (width) x 480 (height)  I.E 640 BOXES OR PIXELS IN WIDTH
HD = 1280 x 720
FHD = 1920 x 1080
4k = 3840 x 2160


Binary images has only two levels 
0 = black
1 = white

For detailed image we increase the levels: 
2 levels,
6 levels,
16 levels

2 power 8 = 256 (an 8 bit values)s
i.e between white and black we have 254 colors, we have 254 colors of shades of gray
0 will be black and 255 will be white

gray scale image are 8 bits or 256 levels

#### for color images, we have 3 gray scale images
Red + Green + Blue
RGB VGA = 640 x 480  x 3


#### Installations
